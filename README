NAME
    Apache::LogFile - Interface to Apache's logging routines

SYNOPSIS
      #in httpd.conf
      PerlModule Apache::LogFile
      PerlLogFile |perl/mylogger.pl My::Logger

      #in a Perl script
      print My::Logger "a message to the Log"

DESCRIPTION
    The PerlLogFile directive can be used to hook a Perl filehandle
    to a piped logger or to a file open for appending. If the first
    character of the filename is a `|', the file handle is opened as
    a pipe to the given program. The file or program can be relative
    to the ServerRoot.

    The method interface was written before mod_perl directive
    handlers were introduced, but it still works so the
    documentation remains below:

    The `new' method should be called by a server startup script or
    module.

    The last argument to `new' is optional, it is simply a name that
    can be used to retrive the filehandle via the `handle' method.

      #in a startup file
      use Apache::LogFile ();
      Apache::LogFile->new("|perl/mylogger.pl", "MyLogger");

      #in a request-time file 
      use Apache::LogFile ();
      my $fh = Apache::LogFile->handle("MyLogger");
      print $fh "a message to the log";

    If this argument is not present, the filename will be used the
    handle key, which can also be retrived via the `handle' method.
    The `new' method will return a reference to the filehandle if
    you wish to store it elsewhere, e.g.:

     $MyLog::Pipe = Apache::LogFile->new("|perl/mylogger.pl");

     $MyLog::Append = Apache::LogFile->new("logs/my_log");
